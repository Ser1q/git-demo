Next day I'm walkin' the road
Kickin' rocks, it's my fault
My life's the worst story told
I'll be this way 'til I'm old
I rip a page out the book
I'm just so misunderstood
I always think about her
And when my life felt good

I smoked a cig' on the porch
It doesn't help me at all
I wonder, "What's it all for?
Is this the girl I adored?"
And I know I can't afford
Watchin' her walk out the door
So I keep it to myself
And keep my feet on the floor
