Opa Gangnam style

Aye aye, this is my feature now
Hola hola ola mola
Branching is being done 
In feature skora

Again and again, goes some 
Lines into the txt 

I'm not tryna ruin your fun
You're just a little bit late, I guess you're already done
There's this feeling I can't shake 'cause I'm too dumb
I'm never doing the right thing, so I'm so stuck

If you see me in America, I might say, "Hi"
But if you meet me out in Europe, I'm a talkative guy
Maybe we'll talk over scones around lunch some time
And I've never been to France, so it might be nice

But I can't take this paparazzi, jeez
It's like the camera's always out and always starin' at me
